Cub3D is a 42 school team project to create a dynamic view inside a 3D maze. Using the [MiniLibX library](https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux), we must implement raycasting in the style of the famous [Wolfenstein 3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D) game, the first true FPS in video game history.
